I have created an e-commerce website in react using redux toolkit, tailwind css, yup, formik. I have also attached the demo video.


By default i have added 2 users customer and admin:

for customer:-    id:customer password:123
for admin:-       id:admin password:123

- Formik and Yup used in checkut form and addproduct form for validation.
- "https://fakestoreapi.com/products" Data fetched from this api and have made categories based on the items in this api
- tailwind css used for styling
- Complete functionalities,complete order process in customer portal and crud operations in admin portal
